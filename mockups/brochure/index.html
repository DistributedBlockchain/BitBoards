                                As our society becomes more reliant on the mobile web, billboards along the highways are becoming more vacant. Fewer companies want to keep throwing money at a problem that doesn't have the sales conversion rates they're looking for.

These strategies still have a high rate of failure because the consumer's attention has moved to the phone.</p>
